## Create a New Branch

```

Replace <b>'username'</b> with your legendary GitHub username.

2. Venture forth into this new realm with the command:

```bash
git checkout username-profile
```

Equip yourself with your profile sword, for it is time to add your unique profile details.

## Add Your Profile

To join the hallowed hall of fame, you shall add your own profile details to the repository. Follow these instructions:

1. Navigate to the <b>'src/components'</b> directory within your local repository.
2. Open the sacred <b>'data.json'</b> file and behold the profiles that have come before you.
3. Fear not, for you shall join their ranks! Using their wisdom as a guide, add your own profile in the following format:

```json
,{
  "username": "your_github_username",
  "name": "your_name",
  "email": "email_id",
  "quote": "sample_quote"
}
```

Replace the placeholder values (<b>'your_github_username'</b>, <b>'your_name'</b>, <b>'email_id'</b>, and <b>'sample_quote'</b>) with your own information.
